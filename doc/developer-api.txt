There are no developer docs at the moment.

Note that builtin pattern operators (the toadstool-impl package) are
written using the pattern-writing protocol (the toadstool-system
package) so they can be studied to understand the system.

If you can't figure something out, drop me an email
(sthalik@test123.ltd.pl).
