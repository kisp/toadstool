There are no developer docs at the moment.

Note that builtin pattern operators (the toadstool-impl package) are
written using the pattern-writing protocol (the toadstool-system
package) so they can be studied to understand the system.

If you can't figure something out, drop me an email
(sthalik@test123.ltd.pl).

An example on how to write custom forms exists in #p"html.lisp".
You need to use the `toadstool-system' package for writing standalone
operators and also `toadstool-impl' for customizing ones included in the
Toadstool distribution.

There's no danger in putting your forms/operators in *used-packages*,
since they only ever run if MATCHES? succeeds.
